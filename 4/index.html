    <h1>Part A: Taking Photos</h1>
    <p>We take a few photos while fixing the center of projection, and rotating the camera while taking photos. <br>
        Below are some examples which were used for part A.
    </p>

    <h1>Recovering Homographies</h1>
    <p> In order to compute for the homographies, we set up a system of equations, using H * [x, y, 1] = [wx', wy', w]. Given this, we can solve for H, which has 8 unknowns. 
        To do so, we select at least 4 correspondences between two images, and use least squares to solve for the coefficients. <br>

        The system of equations is basically A = [[x, y, 1, 0, 0, 0, -x'*x, -y'*x], [0, 0, 0, x, y, 1, -x'*y, -y'*y]], x = [a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h], b=[x', y'], for each of the corresponding points.
    </p>

    
    <h1>Warping Images</h1>
    <p> For this, we first use the homography matrix H on each of the corners to find the structure of the resulting warp, and create a bounding box for it. 
        We then warp, using the inverse warp from the points in the quadrilateral, and use interpolation to get the pixel values of the resulting image. (This also 
        has to be translated by the upper left corner to go to 0, 0). <br>
        Below are some results, as well as the result of rectifying a few different things.

    <h1>Blending Images</h1>
    <p>
        First, we have to warp one image onto the other. From there, we need to specify the size of the resulting bounding box for both images. We do this by 
        transforming one of the corresponding points using H, and find how much it is translated by. Then we specify the size of the resulting image by
        taking the minimum and maximum of the resulting corners, as well as get how much we need to translate the indices by for the top left corner, which gives us 
        where to put the images. From there, we first create a mask using the distance from the image pixels to the borders using cv2.distanceTransform (which gives the distance to the 
        nearest white pixel). Then, we create a gaussian and laplacing pyramid (using project 2 code). We merge it in a similar way, but we simply use the average of the 
        distance mask to merge each layer of the pyramid. Placing these pixels onto the final grid gives us the resulting mosaic image. <br>

        While I don't have an example of 3 images (at least yet), the way to merge multiple images is by saving how much the reference points have been translated, 
        and applying this translation to its reference points with the other image before passing it into the function again. <br>

        Below are the images as well as their resulting mosaic image. There is a bit of artifacting on the campanile and otamatone scene but this is 
        due to camera movements (it's hard to not move the camera when the scene is as small as a room), this is most noticeable with the Ilios scene as it is easy 
        to perfectly rotate the camera in-game, resulting in no issues when merging.
